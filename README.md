# iOS Calendar

A minimal, responsive, iOS-style calendar component built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This calendar mimics the look and feel of the native iOS calendar with smooth transitions, bold typography, and intuitive navigation across months.

## Features

- Display full monthly view with days aligned to weekdays
- Navigation between months using left/right arrows
- Highlights current selected date
- Follows iOS-style UI: dark mode, centered month/year label, circular selected day
- Week starts on Monday
- Responsive layout: works across mobile and desktop
- Localized day labels in Bahasa Indonesia

## Future Improvements

- Add year picker / dropdown
- Support event dots or badges under certain days
- Allow multi-date range selection
- Convert to a reusable Web Component or Vue/React plugin
